The Zimbu program converts the Zimbu code to C code and compiles it with any
ordinary C compiler.  This means it works on any system with a C compiler.

  prog.zu -> prog.c -> prog


For most people: Use the binary program "zimbu" that reads:
	project file
	*.zu input files
	any data files
Zimbu generates ANSI C code.  Using a C90 or C99 compiler will also work.


DIRECTLY CREATING A PROGRAM

      zimbu -o prog main.zu

This will create the executable "prog" from the Zimbu file "main.zu".
If you leave out "-o prog" the executable will be called "main".
All the imported files will be added automatically.


DIRECTLY EXECUTING A PROGRAM

      zimbu prog.zu -x

This will compile prog.zu into the executable "prog" and execute it.


ZIMBU SCRIPT

Add this line to the top of a Zimbu source file:

        #!/usr/bin/env zimbush

Then make it executable and run it.  The hello.zu file is an example.

        chmod +x hello.zu
        ./hello.zu


BOOTSTRAP

The Zimbu generated C code comes from the Zimbu source files:

                  (1)                (2)
        zimbu.zu  ------>  zimbu.c  ------>   zimbu
                  zimbu               cc       |
                   ^                           |
                   |                           |
                   +---------------------------+

(1): On a computer where "zimbu" is already available.
(2): On any computer with a C compiler.
     Uses the generated C code, uses a simple, portable Makefile
