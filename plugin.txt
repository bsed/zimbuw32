Writing a Zimbu compiler plugin


See the plugin/proto directory for an example.
The only special thing about it is that it uses the name PROTO, which is a
reserved name, since it's a builtin plugin.


In the generated file you can import your library modules:

       IMPORT "$PLUGIN/pluginname/lib.zu"

Here $PLUGIN is the Zimbu plugin directory, normally ends in "plugin".
"pluginname" is the name of your plugin, the subdirectory in "plugin".
